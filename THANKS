While ConMan has been originally written by Chris Dunlap <cdunlap@llnl.gov>,
the following people have contributed in its development:

* Natalie Protasevich <nprotasevich@lnxi.com> - initial IPMI SOL implementation
  using external processes

* Levi Pearson <lpearson@lnxi.com> - subsequent IPMI SOL implementation using
  FreeIPMI's libipmiconsole (which I still need to merge into the trunk)

* Brian J. Murrell <brian.murrell@sun.com> - initial Unix domain socket
  implementation

* Mike T. Spangler <mike.t.spangler@boeing.com> - testing of hp-ilo.exp

* Christopher D. Maestas <cdmaestas@comcast.net> - driver for hp-lo100.exp
