# - Whitespace is ignored.
# - Comments are ignored (from the pound char to the newline).
# - Directives are terminated by a newline.
# - Directives may span multiple lines by escaping the newline
#     (ie, immediately preceding it with a backslash char).
# - Integers may begin with either a plus or minus, and contain only digits.
# - Strings may be single-quoted or double-quoted.
# - Strings cannot contain newlines.
# - Unquoted strings are sequences of letters, digits, and underscores;
#     they may not begin with a digit (just like a C identifier).
# - Tokens are unquoted case-insensitive strings.

##
# The daemon's EXECPATH keyword specifies a colon-separated list of directories
#   in which to search for external process-based console executables that are
#   not defined by an absolute or relative pathname.  The default is empty.
##
# server execpath="<dir1:dir2:dir3...>"
##

##
# The daemon's KEEPALIVE keyword specifies whether the daemon will use
#   TCP keep-alives for detecting dead connections.  The default is ON.
##
# server keepalive=(on|off)
##

##
# The daemon's LOGDIR keyword specifies a directory prefix for log files
#   that are not defined via an absolute pathname.
##
# server logdir="<dir>"
##

##
# The daemon's LOGFILE keyword specifies the file to which log messages
#   are appended.  This string undergoes conversion specifier expansion.
#   If an absolute pathname is not specified, the file's location is relative
#   to LOGDIR (assuming it has been previously defined).  This file will be
#   created if it does not already exist.
# The filename may optionally be followed by a comma and a minimum priority
#   at which messages will be logged.  Refer to the syslog.conf(5) man page
#   for a list of priorities.  The default priority is 'info'.
# If this keyword is used in conjunction with the SYSLOG keyword,
#   messages will be sent to both locations.
##
# server logfile="<file>[,<priority>]"
##

##
# The daemon's LOOPBACK keyword specifies whether the daemon will bind its
#   socket to the loopback address, thereby only accepting local client
#   connections directed to that address (127.0.0.1).  The default is OFF.
##
# server loopback=(on|off)
##

##
# The daemon's PIDFILE keyword specifies the file to which the daemon's PID
#   is written.  The use of a pidfile is recommended if you want to use the
#   daemon's '-k' or '-r' options.
##
# server pidfile="<file>"
##

##
# The daemon's PORT keyword specifies the port on which the daemon will
#   listen for client connections.
##
# server port=<int>
##

##
# The daemon's RESETCMD keyword specifies a command string to be invoked by
#   a subshell upon receipt of the client's "reset" escape.  Multiple commands
#   within a string may be separated with semicolons.  This string undergoes
#   conversion specifier expansion and will be invoked multiple times if the
#   client is connected to multiple consoles.
##
# server resetcmd="<str>"
##

##
# The daemon's SYSLOG keyword specifies that log messages are to be sent
#   to the system logger (syslogd) at the given facility.  Refer to the
#   syslog.conf(5) man page for a list of facilities.
# If this keyword is used in conjunction with the LOGFILE keyword,
#   messages will be sent to both locations.
##
# server syslog="<facility>"
##

##
# The daemon's TCPWRAPPERS keyword specifies whether the daemon will
#   use Wietse Venema's TCP-Wrappers when accepting client connections.
#   Support for this feature must be enabled at compile-time
#   (via configure's "--with-tcp-wrappers" option).  Refer to the
#   hosts_access(5) and hosts_options(5) man pages for more details.
#   The default is OFF.
##
# server tcpwrappers=(on|off)
##

##
# The daemon's TIMESTAMP keyword specifies the interval between timestamps
#   written to all console log files.  The interval is an integer that may
#   be followed by a single-char modifier; 'm' for minutes (the default),
#   'h' for hours, or 'd' for days.  The default is 0 (ie, no timestamps).
##
# server timestamp=<int>(m|h|d)
##

##
# The global LOG keyword specifies the default log file to use for each
#   CONSOLE directive.  This string undergoes conversion specifier expansion
#   and must contain either '%N' or '%D'.  If an absolute pathname is not
#   given, the file's location is relative to LOGDIR (assuming it has been
#   previously defined).
##
# global log="<file>"
##

##
#  The global LOGOPTS keyword specifies options for console log files.
#    These options can be overridden on an per-console basis by specifying
#    the CONSOLE LOGOPTS keyword.  Note that options affecting the output
#    of the console's logfile also affect the output of the console's
#    log-replay escape.
#  The valid logopts include the following:
#    - "sanitize" or "nosanitize" - sanitized logs convert non-printable
#      characters into 7-bit printable characters.
#    - "timestamp" or "notimestamp" - timestamped logs prepend each line
#      of console output with a timestamp in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format.
#      This timestamp is generated when the first character following the
#      line break is output.
#  The default is "nosanitize,notimestamp".
##
# global logopts="nosanitize,notimestamp"
##

##
# The global SEROPTS keyword specifies options for local serial devices;
#    These options can be overridden on an per-console basis by specifying
#    the CONSOLE SEROPTS keyword.
# The default is "9600,8n1" for 9600 bps, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.
##
# global seropts="9600,8n1"
##

##
#  The global IPMIOPTS keyword specifies global options for IPMI
#    Serial-Over-LAN devices.  These options can be overridden on a per-console
#    basis by specifying the CONSOLE ipmiopts keyword.  This directive is only
#    available if compiled with the "--with-freeipmi" option.
#  The valid ipmiopts include the following:
#    - <username> is a string of at most 16 bytes that specifies the username
#      with which to authenticate to the BMCs serving the remote consoles.
#    - <password> is a string of at most 20 bytes that specifies the password
#      with which to authenticate to the BMCs serving the remote consoles.
#    - <K_g> is a string of at most 20 bytes that specifies the K_g key with
#      which to authenticate to the BMCs serving the remote consoles.
#  Both the <password> and <K_g> keys can be specified in either ASCII or
#    hexadecimal; in the latter case, the string should begin with "0x"
#    and contain at most 40 hexadecimal digits.
##
# global ipmiopts="<username>,<password>[,<K_g>]"
##

##
# The CONSOLE directive defines a console being managed by the daemon.
# The NAME keyword specifies the name used by clients to refer to the console.
# The DEV keyword specifies the type and location of the device.  
#   - A local serial-port connection is defined by the pathname of the
#     character device file.
#   - A remote terminal-server connection using the telnet protocol is defined
#     by the "host:port" format (where "host" is a hostname or IPv4 address,
#     and "port" is a remote port number).
#   - An external process-based connection is defined by the "path args" format
#     (where "path" is a pathname to an executable file/script, and any
#     additional "args" are space-delimited).
#   - An IPMI Serial-Over-LAN connection is defined by the "ipmi:host" format
#     (where "ipmi" is the literal string and "host" is a hostname or IPv4
#     address).
#   The '%N' character sequence will be replaced by the console name.
# The optional LOG keyword specifies the file where console output is logged.
#   This string undergoes conversion specifier expansion.  If an absolute
#   pathname is not given, the file's location is relative to LOGDIR
#   (assuming it has been previously defined).  An empty log string
#   (ie, log="") disables logging, overriding the global log name.
# The optional LOGOPTS, SEROPTS, and IPMIOPTS keywords override the global
#   settings.
