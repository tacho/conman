ConMan is a serial console management program designed to support a
large number of console devices and simultaneous users.  It supports local
serial devices, remote terminal servers (via the telnet protocol), external
processes (e.g., using Expect to control connections over telnet or ssh),
and IPMI Serial-Over-LAN.

Its features include:
  - logging (and optionally timestamping) console device output to file
  - connecting to consoles in monitor (R/O) or interactive (R/W) mode
  - allowing clients to share or steal console write privileges
  - broadcasting client output to multiple consoles
